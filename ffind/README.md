# ffind
Find files and directories in local and remote files (via ssh) with a single instruction.

## Usage
```
ffind word1 word2 etc
```
## Rationale
I wrote this script to search for files between several media centers (raspberry pi's) and my local computer so I can find duplicates easily.

## Features
- Static config of remote folders. You can configure several folders on servers to be accessed via SSH. Remote "find" (linux) commands are executed v√≠a SSH on the servers. It is recommended to configure your accounts on the servers using key authentication (use password-less keys unless you want to type the password for each server on each call).
- Static config of local folders. The current local folder is added by default (can be removed).
- Filenames are treated as no case-sensitive.
- Result files will contain ALL search strings (AND).
- Debug info can be turned on if you want to see additional information.
- Independent config file. Check your *ffind-custom.config-example* for more information.

## Requirements and Notes
- This script has been tested on GNU bash version 4.3.48 only. It should work with other later versions. Use "bash --version" to check your own.
- Tested only with find (GNU findutils) version 4.7.0. Use "find --version" to check your own.

## Configuration
- Modify the file *ffind-custom.config-example* rename it to *.ffind-custom.config* and place it in the same folder as your ffind script.
- Check your *ffind-custom.config-example* for more information.
